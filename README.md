# Quasi-dynamic-Simulation-of-a-Hydraulic-Landing-Gear-Actuation-System
This script was developed as part of a project for an exam within B.Sc. of Aerospace Engineering at University of Pisa (Italy)

It consists only of one file containing the MATLAB script for the simulation.

The project (consisting of the script, several hand calculations to obtain the differential equations for the motion, and a final report) has been developed together with 4 other classmates.
